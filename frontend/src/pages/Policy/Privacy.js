          When you use Twain’s products, you’re trusting us to handle your
          personal information with care. We take that trust seriously. This
          Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your
          personal information. When we refer to our products in this Privacy
          Policy, we’re referring to all of our products and services, including
          our apps, websites, and software. If you are a member of a Twain
          Business team account, please note that your organization controls the
          information processed for writing suggestions because, in that case,
          we are acting as a processor on behalf of your organization.

          <li>
            To provide you with writing suggestions, we process your text. To

            When you join a Twain Business or Twain for Education team account,
